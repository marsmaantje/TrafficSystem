# TrafficSystem
A simple traffic system in unity

the traffic system works with waypoints, each waypoint has a position, radius and a list of connections to other waypoints.

With this you can create a grid/mesh of connected waypoints that an agent can traverse.

Provided in the demo is a simple agent that picks a random waypoint each time it reaches its target, this results in movement that does not always look great, but it works, and is incredibly simple to understand.
